# DM-info
A kind of User Manual repository for SwissMicros devices.

The info that is currently available on the [SwissMicros website](https://www.swissmicros.com/) must be somehow available as an off-line **User Manual** for anyone needing the information; if you try to download a page from the website as HTML (full), you will notice that this is difficult (or bulky if using a web scraper)...

This project is a first attempt to concentrate the information in an easy way (pending a possible better solution by SwissMicros, and/or hopefully stimulate them to deal with this issue). Ideally, this could be a shared, open sourced  effort.

What would be needed off-line:

* Battery replacement
* config
    * LCD contrast setting
    * fonts
    * speed
* other key combinations
* instructions how to set up the serial console
* firmware install/upgrade procedures for all platforms, with link to [website](https://www.swissmicros.com/firmware/?C=M;O=D)
* memory versions information
* [HTML utility](https://www.swissmicros.com/nut_decoder.html)
* Links to
    * HP user manuals
    * driver (FlashMagic, lpc2lisp, ...)
* Ideally...
    * sourcecode of the Firmware update tool?
    * be able to export this GitHub project as e.g. PDF
* And in a distant future
    * If SwissMicros ever consider leaving the market for whatever reason, they should open source their code so other can take over if needed.
